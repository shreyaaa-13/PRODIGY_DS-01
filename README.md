# PRODIGY_DS-01

##  Overview

As part of the data visualization internship task, this project explores global population trends using data from the World Bank.  
The goal is to craft an insightful **bar chart** or **histogram** to represent the distribution of a continuous variable — in this case, **country-wise population for the year 2024**.

##  Project Contents

- `script.py` – Python script that reads, cleans, and visualizes the dataset.  
- `output.png` – A crisp bar chart showing the **Top 10 most populated countries**.  
- `README.md` – This documentation file.

##  How to Run

1. **Download the dataset**  
   Grab the latest population dataset from:  
   [🌐 World Bank: SP.POP.TOTL](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

2. **Set up your workspace**  
   Place the downloaded file in the same folder as `script.py` and rename it as:  
   **`Task-01.csv`**

3. **Execute the script**  
   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   python script.py
