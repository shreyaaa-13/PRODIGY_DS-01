# 🌍 PRODIGY_DS_01: Visualizing World Population Trends

## 📌 Overview

As part of the data visualization internship task, this project explores global population trends using data from the World Bank.  
The goal is to craft an insightful **bar chart** or **histogram** to represent the distribution of a continuous variable — in this case, **country-wise population for the year 2022**.
